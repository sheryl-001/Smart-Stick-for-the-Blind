The Arduino Nano can be programmed to interface with the ultrasonic sensor, LED, buzzer, vibration motor, and other components to provide the desired functionality.

Ultrasonic Sensor: The ultrasonic sensor plays a key role in obstacle detection. It emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By calculating the distance to the obstacle, it provides input to the Arduino Nano, enabling the smart stick to detect and react to obstacles in the user's path.

LED: The LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a visual indicator that can be used to convey important information. In the smart stick project, the LED can be used to display the status of the system, such as indicating low battery levels or signaling when an obstacle is detected.

Buzzer: The buzzer is an audio output device that emits sound signals. It can be used to provide audible alerts to the user in response to detected obstacles. By emitting different tones or patterns, the buzzer assists the visually impaired user in perceiving the proximity and location of obstacles in their environment.

Vibration Motor: The vibration motor provides haptic feedback to the user. When an obstacle is detected, the vibration motor can be activated to provide tactile sensations, alerting the user to the presence of the obstacle. This feedback mechanism enhances the user's situational awareness and assists in obstacle avoidance.

Stick: The stick serves as the physical framework for the smart stick project, providing a familiar and ergonomic form factor for users to hold and manipulate. The stick can be designed to securely house the components, such as the Arduino Nano, ultrasonic sensor, LED, buzzer, vibration motor, and battery.
